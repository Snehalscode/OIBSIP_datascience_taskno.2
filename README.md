Unemployment Rate Analysis During Covid-19 in India
Objective
The project aims to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the unemployment rate across various states and regions of India. By examining monthly unemployment data before, during, and after the lockdown periods, the project seeks to identify trends, regional variations, and the magnitude of disruptions caused by the pandemic.

Steps Performed
Data Collection: Gathered monthly unemployment data by state and area (rural/urban) covering pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.

Data Cleaning: Processed the dataset to handle missing values, standardized formatting, and ensured consistency in date and regional fields.

Data Exploration: Examined unemployment rates over time through summary statistics and trend analysis.

Visualization: Created time series plots, regional comparison charts, and heatmaps to illustrate changes and spikes associated with Covid-19 lockdowns.

Analysis: Investigated significant increases in unemployment rates during lockdown months (April–June 2020), focusing on rural vs urban disparities and state-level differences.

Reporting: Summarized insights on the temporal and spatial impact of Covid-19 on unemployment, highlighting vulnerable regions and populations.

Tools Used
Python 3.x

pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning

matplotlib / seaborn: Data visualization

numpy: Numerical operations

Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts: For interactive data analysis and reproducibility

Outcome
The analysis revealed a sharp rise in unemployment rates across most Indian states during the Covid-19 lockdown months, with some states experiencing spikes above 40–50% unemployment in urban or rural areas. Post-lockdown recovery showed a gradual decline in unemployment but with persistent regional disparities. The project provides valuable insights to understand labor market vulnerabilities during crises and can inform policy interventions for future economic disruptions.
